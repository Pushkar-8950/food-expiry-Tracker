# food-expiry-Tracker
A simple Streamlit web app that helps you keep track of food items and their expiry dates — so you never have to deal with expired stuff again.  You can add items manually or scan expiry dates directly from images using built-in OCR (Tesseract). The app automatically extracts text, detects expiry dates, and stores everything in SQLite database.
